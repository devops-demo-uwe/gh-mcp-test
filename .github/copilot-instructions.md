# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a demo repository for testing GitHub Copilot functionality.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Follow conventional commit message format
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic

## Preferred Patterns
- Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript syntax when applicable
- Prefer explicit over implicit code
- Include error handling where appropriate

## Local Development Workflow
- NEVER use terminal git commands
- ALWAYS use GitHub MCP server for all Git operations
- For file changes: "Push these files to branch X with commit message Y"
- For branch creation: "Create branch X and push initial files"
